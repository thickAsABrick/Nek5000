This example demonstrates construction of a 3D annulus
with flow driven by thermal convection.

It has not been thoroughly tested -- just simply set up
to demonstrate mesh construction and running.

Geometry is set by parameters in 3da.box.

Parameters derive from one3d.rea.  

Some of the parameters (viscosity, density, rhoCP, conductivity)
are set in 3da.usr.


If you have built genbox, genmap, and postx, and if
you have gfortran and gcc installed, then simply type

run

to invoke a script that will build the mesh and run 
the case.
